# TO DO

- Make sure gimblies still work

- Figure out the actual Gimbly Encoder Gear Ratio

- Add capabilities to have each motor have their own PID values

- Make a function to convert an int to 4 byte data and vise-versa

- PID position control for gimbals

- Velocity PID control for M3508 Motor

- Reverse functionality

- Tune PID Position Control

- Instead of two MotorOut Arrays, Make there only one!!

- Grab more can wires so we can test multiple motors at once
